### Setting up your Github space

#### Get Git: Configure Git

Lo, of course I run into issues right off the bat, as upon verifying that I had set up git correctly, I was greeted by an error Error: Command failed: /bin/sh -c git config user.email Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges Commence flashbacks and the horror of trying to get HomeBrew installed from last year. Luckily I stayed my head, and simply searched the error online. Turns out it's become pretty common with new iterations of OS X, and all that's needed to circumvent this is to manually open Xcode (can be found via Launchpad) and accept the new user agreement.
