### "Federated Education: New Directions in Digital Collaboration," Mike Caulfield
- You don't know who could benefit from your information, so you should always publish as openly as possible
- To make use of the information we have, we need to:
	- Record it somewhere
	- Route it to the right people
	- Extend, Organize, Localize it
	- Pass it back into the stream for the next iteration
- Federated wiki?
	- Consensus engine wanted eventually, but not from the beginning
	- Everyone on one server vs. everyone on their own server
	- This confuses me a little... 
		- It doesn't seem like to would quite out as a replacement for like... Wikipedia, but as a research tool, like Github, basically?
			- It's like fancy, academic tumblr
