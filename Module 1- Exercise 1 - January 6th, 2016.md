###Dillinger Exercise Instructions
 
1. You will need this cheatsheet.
 2. Go to dillinger.io in a new browser window. This looks like a wordprocessor. The left hand side of the screen is where you write, the right hand side shows you what your text will look like. Dillinger 'saves' your work in your browser's memory. You can also point it to save to your dropbox, google drive, or github account (under the cogwheel icon. Do you have a dropbox etc account? You should set that up now, if you don't).
 3. Write a short 200-500 word piece on why you are taking this class; what you hope to achieve here; the kind of digital experience you already have versus the kind of experience you wish to have.
 4. Have at least two images (creative commons licensed for re-use - do you know how to find these?) and link outwards to four websites that are relevant to your piece.
 5. In the 'document name' slot, make sure to add the file type .md at the end
 6. 'Save to' your dropbox, github, google drive, or one drive account.
