## Tracking the Ephemeral Web
### "Saving info (and your skin) on the ephemeral Internet: a "how-to" for researchers," Donna Yates
- What happens if your sources disappear? It's like foundation of the house that is your argument is crumbling.
- **The Internet exists only in the present.**
- Link rot, where URLs no longer point to anything (404'd) is rampant

#### So, How does one go about doing this?
- https://archive.org/web/
- The Wayback machine bookmarklet
- Bibdesk or another BibTex application
- Save it as a PDF
- https://perma.cc
- Printer
- External hard drive (x3)
- Cloud storage services

    - Bare minimum, and only if you think you want to read it again, you should click on the Wayback Machine bookmarklet that will create an archived version of the page there.
    - If it's of supreme academic importance to you, you should sit down and take the time to input as much important data about the resource into BibDesk (or similar)
	Then save it as a PDF
    - If you're looking to cite the article in an academic text, perma.cc is the way to go.

#### Blog Spiel
This exercise strikes at the core of one of the things I struggle with immensely while on the web - how do I keep track of all the cool stuff I find? I've got a disturbingly long reading list within Safari; a huge number of saved links on Reddit, some that I wanted to keep around for later, others are just things I didn't have time to read; over a thousand 'pins' on Pinterest, varying from clothing, to recipes, to gift ideas; and extensive bookmarked folders full of things I've found and want to keep around, one of which is importantly called "Fellowship." 

While all my other 'saved' things will continue to infuriate me with their lack of organization and my realistic expectation that I'm probably never going to look back through anywhere close to *all* those links, the post ["Saving info (and your skin) on the ephemeral Internet: a "how-to" for researchers,"](http://www.anonymousswisscollector.com/2015/10/saving-info-and-your-skin-on-the-ephemeral-internet-a-how-to-for-researchers.html) by Donna Yates made me painfully aware of how violate and unstable parts of my research regarding the Carleton campus space for my fellowship is.   

Yates outlines a ton of excellent ways to ensure that you never run into the foundation of your research crumbling beneath you again in her post. Some of the things, and she acknowledges this, are a little... much? Saving things to the Wayback Machine? 100%, going to do that with all things from now on; partially because it ultimately helps serve a lot of people in attempting to maintain a complete archive of the web. I also really like the idea of using perma.cc for things that I would think I would like to use later, but don't really translate well into being saved as a PDF or catalogued in BibDesk. Saving important things as PDFs? Genius, definitely going to do that with important documents as soon as possible and will continue to do so in the future. Likewise with the BIbDesk type process, though again, I'm not going to do that with every single thing that I find that could maybe be relevant to my research. Ideally, I should have a separate hard drive for backing up academic material, but realistically, I forgot to back up my entire machine half the time, so maintaining a "Time Machine" of my computer is about as good as I can realistically get.

As for printing paper copies: never. Unless I actively know that someone is out to hunt down anyone who has a copy of that material and kill them, I will not be maintaining a paper mountain of academic articles and resources. This is almost solely because I know myself, know that I will never touch that mountain again unless it's to recycle the entire dang thing. It's ultimately just not a realistic option for me.
