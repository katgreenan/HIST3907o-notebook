## You did send me back to the future, but I'm back, I'm back from the future!

I couldn't quite help myself, the above quote from [Back to the Future Pt. II](https://youtu.be/jFuKfTjR2q4?t=1m54s) is just far too fitting to not open this exercise with. It's a strange feeling, exploring some new things, but seeing and doing quite a few things that I have already done - perhaps this is because I have been here before. See, I took the pilot version of this course last Winter; let's just say it was [a bit of a trainwreck.](http://i.imgur.com/9Ob752b.webm) Why was it a train wreck? Well:  
 1. I procrastinated, extensively seen in this lovely screenshot I took of my GitHub homepage near the end of term:![Git Repo](http://i.imgur.com/VMiPD5n.png)  
 This lead to me attempting to complete everything from partway through Module 2 onward in less than a week  
      + Not only did this result in some extreme(ly unneccessary) stress due to a tight deadline, but additionally, I made careless mistakes that further expanded the amount of time it took me to complete the exercises  
      + Even worse, by working on such a tight deadline when I knew I should have had so much more work completed, I no longer felt that I was able to reach out for help with material when I was legitimately stumped  
2. I never went to any of the study sessions organized by Dr. Graham or fellow class mates. Even before I put everything off, I wasn't a fan of **asking for help.** I was too foolishly proud to admit that I was out of my depth, and I suffered because of it 

 Why on Earth would I choose to submit myself to this torturous class that I quietly dropped at 11:55 PM on the last day of classes because I was certain that I was going to fail? Well, [because I said I would.](https://complexbydegree.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/the-end-or-is-it/) I made a promise to myself, that should I be given the opportunity, I would take on the class that broke me once again - that I would prove to myself that I could handle a challenge. So, here I am - ![hi](http://img02.deviantart.net/5751/i/2015/269/3/e/mister_dragon_says_hi_by_sean7700-d9b0ixn.jpg)  
one year older, hopefully a little wiser, determined to make *new* mistakes, and with a newfound appreciation in the beauty of [failing gloriously](http://kathryngreenan.grahamresearchfellow.org/), preferrably in public, where everyone can see.
