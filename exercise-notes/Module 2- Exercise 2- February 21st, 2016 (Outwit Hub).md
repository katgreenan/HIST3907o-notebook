## Outwit Hub

"Outwit hub is a piece of software that lets you scrape the html of a webpage. It comes with its own browser. In essence, you look at the html source code of your page to identify the markers that embrace the information you want. Outwit then copies just that information into a table for you, which you can then download."

So, of course I kind of jumped the gun last exercise by going into the source code, but this is what happens when you refuse to look ahead because that's how we got to be on reading week and sprinting to catch up. That's not important though, just means I'm super prepared for exercise two, hurray! 

### The Instructions, Boiled Down and a Discovery
- Take a look at the Suda Online and do a search for `pie`
- Right-click anywhere on the results page, and 'view source'
- Take note of the Adler number and Translation
	- Adler: <strong>Adler number: </strong>alpha,3114
<br/>
	- Translation: <div class="translation">Meaning you will depart. <a href="http://www.stoa.org/finder/showlinks?kws=Sophocles">Sophocles</a> [sc. uses the word].</div>
- Open Outwit Hub and paste the Suda Online URL into the address bar...
- And then discover this: ![the past](http://i.imgur.com/ONiAI35.png)
- Laugh, look at the date, look at today's date, and brightly congratulate yourself for improving 
- Redo the search because you are wholly committed to giving this your all
- Discover that your previous scrape didn't contain the translation
- Compare the two scrapers, see nothing
- Shrug, and carry on about your day

### Summary

Upon exporting my data, I appreciated that the collection time was exported as well. While it may not necessarily be incredibly helpful in this particular case, that information could be extremely valuable if one were scraping information from a site that is updated frequently. One could use the collection time (if one were scraping in real time, ideally) to map trends over time. The fact that the source URL is also included is great, because it allows a greater analysis of the information, especially since the CSV file does not support the Greek characters in the translation section.

#### Section Blog Spiel

Since I had a bit of a moment in the middle of this exercise (you can find it in my notes from the section in my notebook) I figured it would be a good idea to address the laughter mid-exercise as well as evaluate what went wrong, and how we got to this, right now, where I'm hopping back in the saddle. 

To recap, module 1 went swimmingly. I had an event the evening that the module was due, and promised myself that I would not be allowed to attend if I did not complete my work. As of January 14th, I was done module 1. I was on my game, I had a system, and nothing could stop me. Except for the common cold, apparently. Being sick pushed me past my deadlines that I'd set for myself, and instead of catching up, I just let this happen: ![Todoist](http://i.imgur.com/0wXPKZk.jpg?1)This is shockingly not a nice feeling, but hey, sometimes you just lose your way, and that's okay! 

Why is it okay, you may ask? You may ask what demented, twisted world I live in which this is okay? Why it okay for it to be February 21st and be just finally trudging through module two when I should be ready to start module 4? Well, because of this: ![Original Data](http://i.imgur.com/16Dw2N3.png). Because where I am, right now in this beast, on February 21st, is where I was on March 30th the last time we tangoed. That is to say, I was at that point a week before the last day of classes for the term. This got me thinking, where had I actually been on February 21st last time around? And the answer is a little [scary.](https://complexbydegree.wordpress.com/2015/02/21/in-which-we-begin-a-month-and-a-half-late/) Yup, you read that right, last time around, I *hadn't even started* on the course at this point. 

This isn't to say that putting things off is good, but in my world where time has a funny way of disappearing on me, I like to celebrate the little, tiny wins, even if that win is starting things a little less late than last time.
