### "Topic Modelling Martha Ballard's Diary," by Cameron Blevins 
-cries-
- Cringes at the thought of trying to read and comprehend the vernacular before morning coffee
- MALLET (Machine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit)
	- "Java-based package for statistical natural language processing, document classification, clustering, topic modelling, information extraction, and other machine learning applications to text."
	- capable of even identifying when Ballad was discussing her emotions

### "The Joys of Abundance: The Era of Big Data," from *The Historian's Macroscope*
- Definition of "big data" changes depending on who you ask
	- For ease in this course, consider it 'more data than you could conceivable read yourself in a reasonable amount of time - or, - information that requires computational to make new sense of it.'
	- "Implications of this 'era of big data'"

### "The Third Wave of Computational History," from *The Historian's Macroscope*
- "90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone." - IBM, 2012
- Third wave: decreasing storage costs and the implication for historians; the power of the Internet and cloud computing; and the rise of open-source tools.
- Technological advances at such rapid pace make it difficult to read material that was produced only 10-15 years ago
	- Where the Egyptians left behind the Codex, we will have to leave behind the technology and machines used to access that material
- Data does not preserve itself
- Useful programs:
	- Python
		- Open-source programming language
	- Komodo Edit
		- Open-source editing environment
	- Wget
		- Command line program that lets you download entire repositories of information
	- Search Engine and Clustering
		- The Apache Software Foundation provides this; Enterprise-level search engine that you can index your own sources in, software that clusters it, etc.

### "Academic Journals: The Most Profitable Obsolete Technology in History," Jason Schmitt
- Academic publisher Elsevier has higher operating profits than Apple (39% versus 37%)
- A large research university pays between $3-3.5 million a year in academic subscription fees... and the majority of these journals are produced, reviewed, and edited on a volunteer basis by academics who take part in the tasks for tenure and promotion

### "Code 5: Ian Milligan about GeoCities, Web Archives and Digital History," from *codinghistory.com*
- Listening to this in the background of other readings... half attention
- "Did these people have a community together?"
- What was Geocities?
	- It followed a map format, like it started out with Hollywood, and as 'properties' are taken up, people need to build their webpage in the suburbs, literally along a map, on the edge of a road

### "Seams and Edges: Dreams of Aggregation, Access & Discovery in a Broken World," Tim Sherratt
- "the Googlisation of modern culture"
- "our faith that search will *just work*"
- Nothing natural about Google search results
	- See: Graham's example about how he was so excited about his name showing up higher and higher in Google search results... but that was only on his own machine
- Weiser, 'beautiful seams' - that empower users to manipulate their contexts and connections
- "A google-like search experience offers utility at the expense of critique"
- Crowd-sourced tagging and amendments can inhibit some forms of analysis
- 'Platform'; unpacking the implications
	- "something unfinished"? 

### "The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing," Cory Doctorow
- "I can't let you do that, Dave"
- Digital Rights Management (DRM)
- Computers like this are a bad idea because 1st, they won't solve problems. It only works if the "I can't let you do that, Dave" program stays secret. Second, DRM has *inherently* weak security, which makes overall security weaker
- Apple versus android re: TPMs


### "The Perpetual Sunrise of Methodology," Cameron Blevins
- DH is lagging behind in terms of academic scholarship

### "Illusionary Order: Cautionary Notes for OnlineÂ Newspapers"
- Digitized newspapers can be a great resource, but you need to be aware of its downfalls
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is often quite faulty, resulting in missing out on some great articles
	- This can be things like not recognizing hyphenation (common in side-bar articles), or issues with the microfilms from which things are quite often digitized from
	- Natural Language Processing (NLP) also comes into play in a major ways
- You need to change your search patterns in order to make best use of the material, and never become lazy in searching
- Reminds of discussion on whether the desire to digitize everything is the best thing for the material at hand (like AgriCan tearing apart books to digitize them)
