## "Big Data for Dead People: Digital Readings and the Conundrums of Positivism" by Tim Hitchcock on *Historyonics*

Think of five tags (descriptive labels) you would often use in your research. Then, I would like you to make ten notes on this keynote by Tim Hitchock, Big Data For Dead People. Include at the start of each note's title one (or more) of your tags/descriptive labels. This way, if your tag was 'british history', each time you started a new note with that tag, you'd quickly see all the other notes!
