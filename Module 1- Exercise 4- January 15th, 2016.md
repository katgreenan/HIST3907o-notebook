## Forking & Contributing to a Repository

1. Fork the 'who-we-are' repo for this course.
2. Rename the template.md file with <yourname>.md. Change the file accordingly to edit in your name, and the location of your online HQ & open notebook as properly formatted markdown. Remember, when we're working with files you will need a good text editor. If you're on a Mac, you might already have something like TextWrangler. If you're on Windows, you're out of luck (notepad and wordpad are not useful to us; you can ask me why). I've already mentioned Atom and Sublime Text; make sure you have something appropriate installed. Notepad++ is also good (for windows folks)
3. Make a pull request.
